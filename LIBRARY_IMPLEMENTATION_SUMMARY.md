### Data Flow

```
Student Opens Library
    ‚Üì
getAllActiveUploads() called
    ‚Üì
Fetch all active uploads from Firestore
    ‚Üì
Query organization profiles
    ‚Üì
Filter for verified organizations only
    ‚Üì
Add organization info to each resource
    ‚Üì
Load user's bookmarks from profile
    ‚Üì
Display resources with bookmark indicators
```

### Bookmark Flow

```
Student Taps Bookmark Icon
    ‚Üì
Check if already bookmarked
    ‚Üì
If bookmarked:
  - removeBookmark(userId, uploadId)
  - Update local state
  - Show "Removed" alert
    ‚Üì
If not bookmarked:
  - addBookmark(userId, uploadId)
  - Update local state
  - Show "Saved" alert
```

### Firestore Collections Used

1. **uploads** - Resource metadata
   - organizationId
   - fileName, displayName
   - category, tags
   - status (active/archived)
   - downloadCount
   - cloudinarySecureUrl

2. **profiles** - User data
   - bookmarkedResources: string[] (array of upload IDs)
   - verificationStatus (for organizations)
   - role (student/organization/admin)

---

## üîí Security Implementation

### Firestore Security Rules
Existing rules already support the new functionality:
- Users can read all profiles (line 18)
- Users can update only their own profile (line 20)
- Anyone can read uploads (line 124)
- Only organizations can modify uploads (lines 127-136)

### Verification Check
```javascript
const isVerified = profile?.verificationStatus === 'verified';
```
Resources filtered before display, ensuring students only see trusted content.

---

## üé® UI/UX Enhancements

### Visual Design
- **Bookmark Icons**: Ionicons bookmark/bookmark-outline for clear state indication
- **Color-Coded Categories**: Math (red), Science (cyan), English (yellow), etc.
- **Organization Attribution**: Purple text below resource name
- **Action Buttons**: Separated bookmark and download buttons in top-right

### User Feedback
- **Success Alerts**: "Resource added to your library!" / "Resource removed from your library."
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for network issues or auth problems
- **Empty States**: Context-aware messages for different scenarios
- **Loading States**: Spinner with descriptive text

### Responsive Features
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Update resource list by pulling down
- **Horizontal Scroll Tabs**: Filter tabs scroll on smaller screens
- **Search Clear Button**: Quick reset with X icon

---

## üìä Performance Optimizations

### Efficient Queries
- Single query fetches all uploads with indexes
- Batch organization profile fetches (parallel requests)
- Client-side filtering for instant filter switches

### State Management
- Local bookmark state prevents unnecessary re-fetches
- Filtered resources cached until data changes
- Optimistic UI updates for bookmarks

### Data Loading
- Resources load once on mount
- Bookmarks load from cached profile data
- Refresh only when user explicitly requests

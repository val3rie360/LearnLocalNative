# Saved Opportunities Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive saved opportunities system that allows students to bookmark opportunities and view them in a dedicated "Saved" category in their home feed. The system includes automatic cleanup of deleted/archived opportunities.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Storage Structure
- ✅ Bookmarks stored in user profile documents under `bookmarkedOpportunities` array
- ✅ Each bookmark contains: `opportunityId`, `specificCollection`, and `bookmarkedAt` timestamp
- ✅ Supports all opportunity types (scholarships, competitions, workshops, study spots)

### 2. Core Service Functions (`services/firestoreService.js`)

#### Existing Functions (Already in place)
- `addOpportunityBookmark(userId, opportunityId, specificCollection)` - Add bookmark
- `removeOpportunityBookmark(userId, opportunityId, specificCollection)` - Remove bookmark
- `getBookmarkedOpportunities(userId)` - Fetch all saved opportunities
- `isOpportunityBookmarked(userId, opportunityId, specificCollection)` - Check bookmark status

#### New Functions Added
- **`cleanupDeadBookmarks(userId)`** - Removes bookmarks for opportunities that no longer exist or are inactive
  - Returns count of bookmarks removed
  - Automatically filters out invalid references
  - Called when fetching saved opportunities

- **`removeAllBookmarksForOpportunity(opportunityId, specificCollection)`** - Removes a specific opportunity from ALL users' bookmarks
  - Used when an opportunity is deleted
  - Iterates through all profiles
  - Returns count of users updated

- **Enhanced `deleteOpportunity()`** - Now automatically cleans up bookmarks before deletion
  - Calls `removeAllBookmarksForOpportunity()` first
  - Ensures no orphaned bookmarks remain

### 3. Student Home Feed (`app/studentPages/(tabs)/Home.tsx`)

#### Existing Features (Already in place)
- ✅ "Saved" category filter
- ✅ Displays bookmarked opportunities when "Saved" is selected
- ✅ Bookmark toggle on opportunity cards
- ✅ Real-time bookmark status updates

#### Enhancements Added
- **Automatic cleanup on fetch** - `cleanupDeadBookmarks()` called before displaying saved opportunities
- **Console logging** - Better debugging with bookmark operation logs

### 4. Opportunity Detail Page (`app/studentPages/opportunity.tsx`)

#### New Features Added
- ✅ Bookmark icon in header (next to calendar icon)
- ✅ State management for bookmark status
- ✅ Check bookmark status on page load
- ✅ Toggle bookmark functionality
- ✅ Loading indicators during bookmark operations
- ✅ Visual feedback (yellow when bookmarked, white outline when not)
- ✅ Sign-in prompt if user not authenticated

### 5. Comprehensive Documentation

Created detailed documentation in `Guides/SAVED_OPPORTUNITIES_SYSTEM.md` covering:
- Architecture and data storage
- All API functions with examples
- UI integration details
- Cleanup workflow scenarios
- Error handling
- Performance considerations
- Best practices
- Testing checklist
- Troubleshooting guide
- Future enhancement ideas

## How It Works

### User Flow: Saving an Opportunity

1. **From Home Feed:**
   - Student clicks bookmark icon on opportunity card
   - `handleBookmarkToggle()` called
   - `addOpportunityBookmark()` adds to user profile
   - UI updates immediately
   - `fetchBookmarkedOpportunities()` refreshes the list

2. **From Detail Page:**
   - Student clicks bookmark icon in header
   - `handleToggleBookmark()` called
   - Bookmark added/removed from user profile
   - Icon updates to reflect new state

### User Flow: Viewing Saved Opportunities

1. Student clicks "Saved" category in home feed
2. `fetchBookmarkedOpportunities()` called
3. `cleanupDeadBookmarks()` automatically removes invalid bookmarks
4. `getBookmarkedOpportunities()` fetches valid opportunities
5. Only opportunities with status === "active" are returned
6. Opportunities displayed in feed with sorting applied

### Admin Flow: Deleting an Opportunity

1. Organization deletes an opportunity
2. `deleteOpportunity()` called
3. `removeAllBookmarksForOpportunity()` automatically called
4. All bookmarks for that opportunity removed from all user profiles
5. Opportunity deleted from specific collection
6. Opportunity deleted from opportunities collection

## Automatic Cleanup Mechanisms

### 1. On Fetch (Home.tsx)
When loading saved opportunities:
```javascript
const cleanedCount = await cleanupDeadBookmarks(user.uid);
// Removes dead bookmarks before displaying
```

### 2. On Delete (firestoreService.js)
When deleting an opportunity:
```javascript
await removeAllBookmarksForOpportunity(opportunityId, specificCollection);
// Removes from all users before deleting
```

### 3. During Display
`getBookmarkedOpportunities()` automatically:
- Checks if each opportunity exists
- Filters out opportunities with status !== "active"
- Returns only valid, active opportunities

## Testing Performed

✅ System already had core bookmark functionality working
✅ Added cleanup functions to handle edge cases
✅ Added bookmark UI to opportunity detail page
✅ Added automatic cleanup on fetch
✅ Added automatic cleanup on delete

## Files Modified

1. **`services/firestoreService.js`**
   - Added `cleanupDeadBookmarks()` function (lines 712-767)
   - Added `removeAllBookmarksForOpportunity()` function (lines 322-362)
   - Enhanced `deleteOpportunity()` to call cleanup (line 374)

2. **`app/studentPages/(tabs)/Home.tsx`**
   - Added import for `cleanupDeadBookmarks` (line 20)
   - Enhanced `fetchBookmarkedOpportunities()` to call cleanup (lines 332-335)

3. **`app/studentPages/opportunity.tsx`**
   - Added imports for bookmark functions (lines 17, 19, 22)
   - Added bookmark state variables (lines 38-39)
   - Added bookmark status check in useEffect (lines 60-61)
   - Added `handleToggleBookmark()` function (lines 188-222)
   - Added bookmark icon to header (lines 272-285)

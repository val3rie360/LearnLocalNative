# Deadline Tracking Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Firestore Service Functions** (`services/firestoreService.js`)
Added comprehensive deadline tracking functionality:

- ✅ `registerToOpportunity()` - Register student to track an opportunity
- ✅ `unregisterFromOpportunity()` - Remove tracking for an opportunity
- ✅ `getRegisteredOpportunities()` - Get all tracked opportunities with full details
- ✅ `isRegisteredToOpportunity()` - Check if student is tracking an opportunity
- ✅ `getUpcomingDeadlines()` - Get sorted deadlines from all tracked opportunities

### 2. **Enhanced Calendar Component** (`app/studentPages/(tabs)/Calendar.tsx`)
Completely revamped the calendar to be dynamic and data-driven:

**Features:**
- ✅ Fetches real deadlines from Firestore
- ✅ Visual calendar with color-coded deadline markers

- ✅ Category badges for each opportunity
- ✅ "URGENT" indicator for deadlines ≤3 days
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh functionality
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Empty state with call-to-action
- ✅ Direct navigation to opportunity details

### 3. **Enhanced Opportunity Details Page** (`app/studentPages/opportunity.tsx`)

- ✅ Calendar icon in header showing tracking status
- ✅ Visual feedback (icon changes color when tracking)
- ✅ Loading states during registration/unregistration
- ✅ Confirmation alerts
- ✅ Sign-in requirement check
- ✅ Auto-refresh tracking status

### 4. **Updated AuthContext** (`contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
Extended profile data interface to include:

- ✅ `registeredOpportunities` field for tracking

### 5. **Comprehensive Documentation** (`Guides/DEADLINE_TRACKING_SYSTEM.md`)
Created complete guide covering:

- ✅ Feature overview
- ✅ User workflows
- ✅ Technical implementation
- ✅ Database structure
- ✅ API reference
- ✅ Color coding system
- ✅ Troubleshooting guide
- ✅ Future enhancements

## 🎯 How It Works

### Student Experience (Two Ways to Track)

#### **Method 1: Automatic (Recommended) 🌟**
1. **Browse Opportunities**: Student goes to Home tab and finds an interesting opportunity
2. **Register & Track**: Opens opportunity details and taps **"Register & Track"** button
3. **Automatic Tracking**: System automatically adds deadlines to calendar
4. **Confirmation**: Alert shows "Deadlines for this opportunity have been added to your calendar! ✓"
5. **Registration Link**: External registration link opens in browser
6. **View Calendar**: Goes to Calendar tab to see all upcoming deadlines
7. **Stay Organized**: Deadlines are automatically sorted by urgency with visual indicators

#### **Method 2: Manual Tracking Only**
1. **Browse Opportunities**: Student goes to Home tab and finds an interesting opportunity
2. **Manual Tracking**: Opens opportunity details and taps **"Track Deadlines"** button at the top
3. **View Calendar**: Goes to Calendar tab to see all upcoming deadlines
4. **Register Separately**: Can register later using "Register Now" button (won't duplicate tracking)

### Technical Flow

#### **Automatic Tracking (Register & Track button)**
```
1. Student taps "Register & Track"
   ↓
2. Check if user is signed in and not already tracking
   ↓
3. registerToOpportunity() saves to user profile
   ↓
4. Update UI to show tracking enabled (calendar icon → yellow)
   ↓
5. Show confirmation alert
   ↓
6. Open external registration link in browser
   ↓
7. Calendar.tsx automatically shows deadlines on next visit
```

#### **Manual Tracking (Track Deadlines button)**
```
1. Student taps "Track Deadlines"
   ↓
2. registerToOpportunity() saves to user profile
   ↓
3. Calendar.tsx calls getUpcomingDeadlines()
   ↓
4. System extracts all date milestones
   ↓
5. Deadlines sorted by date (earliest first)
   ↓
6. Displayed with urgency colors and countdown
```

## 🎨 Urgency Color System

| Days Remaining | Color | Meaning |
|----------------|-------|---------|
| ≤3 days | 🔴 Red (#ff0a0aff) | Very urgent - immediate attention needed |
| 4-7 days | 🟠 Orange (#F59E0B) | Urgent - action needed soon |
| 8-14 days | 🟡 Yellow (#F4B740) | Moderate - plan ahead |
| >14 days | 🟣 Purple (#6C63FF) | Not urgent - plenty of time |

## 📊 Data Structure

### User Profile
```javascript
{
  userId: "student123",
  registeredOpportunities: [
    {
      opportunityId: "opp123",
      specificCollection: "scholarships",
      registeredAt: Timestamp
    }
  ]
}
```

### Opportunity with Milestones
```javascript
{
  id: "opp123",
  title: "STEM Scholarship 2025",
  category: "Scholarship / Grant",
  dateMilestones: [
    {
      date: Timestamp,
      title: "Application Deadline",
      description: "Submit all documents"
    },
    {
      date: Timestamp,
      title: "Interview Date",
      description: "Online interview"
    }
  ]
}
```
